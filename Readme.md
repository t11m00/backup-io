# 🔒 backup-io – Open Backups for Databases, Files & Cloud Infrastructure

**backup-io** is an open-source, developer-friendly backup tool that will make it easy to protect your data – databases, files, servers, and buckets – with **policy-as-code**, **client-side encryption**, and **S3-compatible storage**.

Think **Terraform for backups**: one config file, one CLI, and your critical data is safe, verifiable, and easy to restore.

---

## ✨ Vision

- 🗄️ **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB  
- 📂 **File systems:** Backup directories on Linux/Windows servers  
- 🪣 **Object storage:** S3 buckets & S3-compatible services
- 💻 **Servers / VMs:** EC2 instances, on-prem servers, generic VMs  
- ☁️ **SaaS data (future):** Google Workspace, GitHub, etc.  
- ~~🔑 **Encryption:** Client-side AES-256-GCM with KMS integration~~  
- 📦 **Compression & deduplication:** Efficient incremental backups  
- ✅ **Verifiable:** Automatic restore testing  
- ⚙️ **Policy-as-code:** Declarative YAML config for sources, schedules, retention  
- 🌍 **Multi-cloud ready:** Store backups in AWS, GCP or your own S3

## 🚀 Status

🚧 **This project is in early development.**  
Nothing has been built yet — but the roadmap is clear, and contributions are welcome.  

- Config format (YAML) → **coming soon**  
- Docker images / CLI binaries → **coming soon**  
- First prototype: database + file backup to S3 → **planned**

## 🔐 Security Goals

- All data encrypted **before leaving your server**  
- Optional **KMS key management** for envelope encryption  
- Support for **immutable backups** (Object Lock / WORM)  
- Only you hold the keys for restore

## 🌟 Why backup-io?

Existing backup tools are either:
- ❌ **Too enterprise:** expensive, complex, vendor-locked  
- ❌ **Too DIY:** fragile scripts, no verification  

**backup-io** aims to be:
- ✅ **Developer-first**  
- ✅ **Affordable** (friendly to SMBs & startups)  
- ✅ **Trustworthy** (verifiable, encrypted, immutable)
